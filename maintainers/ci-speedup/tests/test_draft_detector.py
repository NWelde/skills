"""Tests for `draft_detector.py` — the phase-4c gap → catalog helper.

The script's value is that its three deterministic halves can't drift from what
the renderer does: a capture is "pending" iff `_parse_log` returns None on its
real job log (same ground truth), `prepare` emits a task only for pending gaps,
and `verify` is a hard gate (a gap that no detector fires on, or one whose
fix_key has no `_FIX_META`, must FAIL). These tests pin each.
